Algorithm 1: Learning from images of human piloting. At each time unit,
1) Modify key reading to record last key pressed
2) Record screenshots from Parrot visual data (how to take stills from video?)
-a) Pair each screenshot with the key pressed
-b) Save the pairs to a file
-c) Repeat as people drive around the course
3) Train a Convolutional Neural Network to learn the key presses from the pictures
4) Send parsed video feed to the base computer (or onboard computer)
5) Base computer processes the image through the model
6) Base computer sends key press to the drone
7) Prepare manual override for landing

Additional Options
1) Group the images into 5 image sequences with the key press of the last image at the end
2) Balance the dataset by having an equal portion of examples of each key press
3) Incorporate alternative sensory inputs (Such as raw telemetry) 
4) Add object detection to the image inputs

Algorithm 2: Adapting a baseline model for the course.
1) Download an existing algorithm for following a digital map
2) Model the obstacle course
3) Use a pathfinding algorithm to determine an optimal path through the course
4) Deploy the algorithm to travel the course

Additional Options
1) Employ evolutionary learning to optomize performance (Big downside, could theoretically crash. Simple Greedy Algorithm described)
-a) Start the existing algorithm
-b) Drive around the course and record key presses at each time interval along the course and the time for a lap
-c) Make a small random change to the recorded key presses
-d) Travel the course with the new key presses and record the new lap time
-e) If the new time is better, keep the changes. Otherwise, keep the old algorithm
-f) Repeat steps a-e for as long as manageable
2) Tune the algorithm to the course using Algorithm 1
